# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Files Created/Modified for Railway

### Configuration Files

- ✅ `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Optimized Docker build
- ✅ `start.sh` - Production startup script
- ✅ Updated `Dockerfile` - Dynamic port and Railway optimizations

### Code Changes

- ✅ Dynamic port configuration (uses Railway's PORT env var)
- ✅ CORS origins from environment variables
- ✅ Enhanced health check endpoint with database status
- ✅ Global error handler for better logging
- ✅ Environment detection and logging

### Environment Variables Required in Railway

Set these in your Railway dashboard:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Optimize for Railway deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway Setup**:

   - Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
   - Railway will auto-detect the Dockerfile
   - Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
   - Deploy!

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check `/health` endpoint for status
   - Verify CORS is working with your frontend
   - Test image upload functionality

## 🔧 Railway-Specific Features

- **Auto Port Detection**: Uses Railway's dynamic PORT variable
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for Railway monitoring
- **Environment Detection**: Logs Railway environment info
- **Optimized Docker**: Fast builds with .dockerignore
- **Production Ready**: Different settings for prod vs dev

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Deploy to Railway
2. Update your frontend CORS_ORIGINS to include Railway domain
3. Test all API endpoints
4. Monitor logs in Railway dashboard
